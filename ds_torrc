# Voting Interval can be:
#   10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 24, 25, 30, 36, 40, 45, 50, 60, ...
# Testing Initial Voting Interval can be:
#    5,  6,  8,  9, or any of the possible values for Voting Interval,
# as they both need to evenly divide 30 minutes.
# If clock desynchronisation is an issue, use an interval of at least:
#   18 * drift in seconds, to allow for a clock slop factor

# Work around situations where the Exit, Guard and HSDir flags aren't being set
# These flags are all set eventually, but it takes Guard up to ~30 minutes
# We could be more precise here, but it's easiest just to vote everything
# Clients are sensible enough to filter out Exits without any exit ports,
# and Guards and HSDirs without ORPorts
# If your tor doesn't recognise TestingDirAuthVoteExit/HSDir,
# either update your chutney to a 2015 version,
# or update your tor to a later version, most likely 0.2.6.2-final
